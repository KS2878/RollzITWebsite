	<h5 class="text-danger m-2">Our Methodology</h5>
	<h2>Take the hassle out of your software development</h2>
	<p class="m-2">When it comes to software development, most leading software companies now outsource the work. It’s more convenient and cost-effective and it lets them focus on other core functions of their business. However, it’s crucial the project is still completed on time and within budget. That’s why enterprises want to work with a team that practices the agile methodology for their software development solutions.</p>
	<p class="m-2">Agile software development requires a much higher level of collaboration between all those involved. As a result, it requires one or both of the parties to make compromises on their traditional processes to adapt to the task in hand. This requires an experienced software partner with whom you can successfully collaborate with to develop customized software solutions as per your requirements. Your agile software development requires someone like us.

Application Mordernization
	</div>
	<div class="a-service-cards_content-title">
	<p>If you are spending more time and IT budget on simply maintaining your traditional applications rather than new innovations and digital transformation, then modernizing these applications to give a new lease of life should be a top priority. </p>

		<p>However, modernization isn’t about a mere change of code, tools and features, but the way you transfer information into new environments – quickly, cost-effectively, and most importantly, without losing data quality and integrity.</p>
		
		<p>At Rollz, Application Modernization Practice helps companies move rapidly through this complicated yet need-of-the hour modernization process and obtain measurable value with less risk. We make full use of your existing application code investments and at the same time, enable you to embrace modern development practices, platforms, architectures and enhance security.</p>
