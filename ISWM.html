<p class="m-2">With the increasing emphasis on compliance with global waste disposal standards and protocols, it is essential that your business uses an efficient waste management software. Even companies that use external firms to take care of the disposal need the software for record keeping, reporting and invoicing. This way, it becomes a lot easier for the business to achieve sustainability targets as well as comply with legal standards of waste disposal. </p>
<p class="m-2">Also, companies that deal with waste management and recycling need to use the software for the sake of remaining profitable in the current competitive and dynamic legislative systems. Use of separate manual spreadsheets and other paper-based systems is outdated and involves too much cost and effort that limits the growth opportunities of such business. Rollz Waste management software is comprehensive and covers all the areas that separate systems deal with, which makes it the perfect solution. </p>
	<!-- <h5 class="text-danger m-2">What is the Rollz Waste Management Software?</h5> -->
	<h2>What is the Rollz Waste Management Software?</h2>
	<p class="m-2">Rollz Waste management software helps businesses in carrying out efficiently the processes involved from the collection to disposal of waste. Such functions include ensuring that the system of waste disposal is in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations, scheduling dates for the collection, transportation, treatment as well as the placement of waste, management of contracts in terms of invoicing and pricing of the services, and creation of workflows for processes such as sorting and destruction.</p>
	<p class="m-2"> Additionally, the software is useful for the sorting of different materials as well as the provision of different functionalities for recycling. Waste management software is also essential for the creation and management of unique waste profiles as well as the display of important notifications and alerts. This makes it easy for the business owners or responsible departments to keep up with the processes as well as take necessary action in case of breaches or any emergencies.
	</p>



<ul>

<li><b>Cost control:</b> Waste management software helps in the identification and selection of the most cost-effective waste collectors, transporters, treatment administrators and disposers. It then manages the processes of invoicing and pricing as well as estimating costs for anticipated waste disposals.</li>
<li><b>Regulatory compliance: </b>The software tracks down and includes all the regulations and standards applicable to all wastes disposal processes carried out by the firm. It also checks the facility’s permits and generates notifications on impending expiry dates. </li>
<li><b>Simplicity and generality:</b> Waste management software is easy to use. It also makes easier to manage waste profiles by combining them into one system where they can all be monitored and controlled, unlike the manual systems where individual profiles are operated on separate levels.</li>
<li><b>Waste reduction effort monitoring:</b> The system produces detailed information and reports on both hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated during any specified time. It also helps the business to make informed decisions based on details from waste profiles and reports </li>
<li><b>Scheduling: </b>It also creates and manages schedules for waste collection and disposal.</li>

</ul>
<p class="m-2"></p>Rollz Waste management Software works under three key concepts :</p>
<li>Monitor</li>
<li>Control </li>
<li>Audit</li>

Vehicle Tracking System
</div>
<div class="a-service-cards_content-title">


	<p>	To ensure efficient Solid Waste Management a GPS based Vehicle Tracking and Monitoring System (VTMS) has been taken up as a significant step recently. </p>
<p>With the available GIS mapping of all waste generators and the defined Route Maps all the waste collection vehicles shall be tracked down at control room.</p>
<p>Every vehicle which is collecting waste shall be fitted with GPS enabled system, routes shall be configured & placed on each GPS, and arrangement of alert generation shall also be provided in case of deviation from route. Critical alerts shall be configured when vehicle deviates from beats. Every route shall be tracked and connected to ERP, ERP shall generate MIS for each routes tracked along with its map.</p>
<h5>The key features of the project are:</h5>
<ul>
 <li>Online real-time monitoring of garbage vehicle movement and effective enforcement through a web based Vehicle Tracking and Monitoring System (VTMS)</li>
<li> Web based application for real-time route adherence of garbage vehicles using data feeds </li>
<li> Installation of IP cameras at entry and exit of the landfill site </li>
<li>Integrated Weighbridge Vehicle Monitoring System (IWVMS) at the entry and exit points </li>
<li> Integration of VTMS with the Central Command and Control Centre</li>
<li> Training to stakeholders for managing the complete VTMS eco-system</li>

		<b>RFID Tagging process would be take place in two parts.</b>
	<P>	1)	Tagging the Household/Properties of municipal corporation.</P>
		<p>2)	Tagging of operation assets and equipment ( Vehicles, Bins etc.) of Municipal corporation. </p>

		<p>RFID reader will send the data feed to the data centre by Rest API call ,

Backend application will map the data to the geographical boundaries i.e. Ward . Zone etc. by spatial query based on the location data sent from mobile application and save the result to database.
Tagging data will then available to visualize on the map as well as in tabular format.</p>

<h5>Integration of  RFID in waste collection process :</h5>
 <p> RFID scanned at the time of waste collection  from household  and bins would be synced to the database server in real time and data would be available for analysis and representation on map and reports.

RDFID attached to the vehicles would be scanned at the Transfer stations ,Dumping points and weighbridge.</p>
